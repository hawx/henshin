for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin&#39; house, fuckin&#39; up the
way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my
ass, &#39;cause I&#39;ll kill the motherfucker, know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?</p>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a
pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the
strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some
pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become
nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>Your bones don&#39;t break, mine do. That&#39;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and
viruses differently than mine. You don&#39;t get sick, I do. That&#39;s also clear. But
for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too
fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I. We&#39;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After
the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&#39;t know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only
five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#39;m breaking now. We said we&#39;d say
it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&#39;t. Nature is lethal but
it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to man.</p>
