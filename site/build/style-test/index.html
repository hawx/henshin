chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I&#39;m in a transitional period so
I don&#39;t wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can&#39;t give you this case, it
don&#39;t belong to me. Besides, I&#39;ve already been through too much shit this
morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>

<p>Now that we know who you are, I <code>&lt;know&gt;</code> who I am. I&#39;m not a mistake! It all makes
sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain&#39;s going to be?
He&#39;s the <em>exact</em> opposite of the hero. And most times they&#39;re friends, like you
and me! I should&#39;ve known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the
kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I&#39;m
talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston
or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You

<p>Look, just because I don&#39;t be givin&#39; no man a foot massage don&#39;t make it right
for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin&#39; house, fuckin&#39; up the
way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my
ass, &#39;cause I&#39;ll kill the motherfucker, know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?</p>

<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After
the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&#39;t know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only
five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#39;m breaking now. We said we&#39;d say
it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&#39;t. Nature is lethal but
it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to man.</p>

<p>Your bones don&#39;t break, mine do. That&#39;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and
viruses differently than mine. You don&#39;t get sick, I do. That&#39;s also clear. But
for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too
fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I. We&#39;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

<p>Do you see any <em>Teletubbies</em> in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped
to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a
blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that
shakes when you put quarters in it? <strong>No?</strong> Well, that&#39;s what you see at a toy
store. And you must think you&#39;re in a toy store, because you&#39;re here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.</p>
