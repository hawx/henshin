# Henshin

Henshin is a static site generator. It takes in posts, or just pages, runs them through plugins and layouts and gives you a folder to put on a webserver. It makes it easy to write archive pages, tags and categories.


## How To

Install with

    (sudo) gem install henshin

Then create a new site

    cd [some directory]
    henshin create

And build your new site with

    henshin


## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project
- Make your feature addition or bug fix
- Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
