You know that when you begin writing something inevitably you will stop. From lack of words to put to page, from lack of food or lack of sleep. Or just the desire to try new things, these all lead to the person writing dummy text to, just, get bored. You know. It's hard, imagine the guy who wrote "lorem ipsum", imagine how he felt after writing it, he must have wanted to die. He'd already experienced hell so what was there to fear.

  Once you stop you lose the flow, the meanderence of the incomprehensible stupid stuff you are typing without even trying
  
- That's it

End
